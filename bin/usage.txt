usage:
  filetran <cmd> [opts] <file>

  cmd:
    send: send a file to another filetran process
    receive: receive a file from another filetran process

  opts:
    -p, --port: The port to connect to or to listen on.
    -h, --host: The host to connect to.
                The host option can be used on either send or receive, but not both at once.
                If the host is not specified, it acts as a server (run this first).
                If a host is specified, it acts as a client (run this second).

  file:
    The filename to read from or write to. (The filenames do not need to match.)

examples:
  filetran receive -p 3000 my-awesome-file.txt
  filetran send -h localhost -p 3000 my-file.js
